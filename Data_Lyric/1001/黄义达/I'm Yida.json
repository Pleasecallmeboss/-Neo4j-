Do you really know who is Yida?\n我一个人过了太久 我空虚了\nThis is how I feel the way I feel.\n离开了家好久好久 我心累了\nThis is how I feel the way I feel.\n寂寞是最好的朋友 也接受了\nThis is how I feel the way I feel.\n我看着镜子里的我 孤单堕落\nThis is how I feel the way I feel.\n我叼着烟躲在角落 我一句话都不想说\nThis is how I feel\n我好想出去走一走 回味我从前的生活\nThis is how I feel\n我一个人努力的过 我没放弃也没退缩\nThis is how I feel\n我的朋友都羡慕我 其实羡慕他们的人是我\nThis is how I feel\n我没有太多的自由 我已经失去了自由\nThis is how I feel the way I feel\n我唱着没人要的歌 但我比谁都更快乐\nThis is how I feel the way I feel\n我爱的人 却不爱我 却征服我 却离开我\n却欺骗我 却伤害我 却背叛我\n我早就原谅你所犯的错\n别再难过 就算爱错 别再哭了 至少爱过\n再抽一口 就往前走\nThis is how I feel the way I feel\nthe way I feel\nthe way I feel\nthe way I feel\n我送你到你家门口 一转眼就是十年後\n我含着泪心不说痛 又怎能忘记我们吻别的时候\n这些年写着我的痛 每个音符都在诉说\n我一直在这里守候 你是否听得见我唱的每一首\n请给我一秒钟就够 让我唱完这一首\n我已沉默太久太久 而岁月它从不留我\nThis is how I feel\n如果是一场梦 别把我唤醒\n让我安静睡 我不想错过\n害怕醒过来 不见你存在\n无奈的拥抱 残酷的实在\n手上的玫瑰 刺在我手心\n痛转移到心 泪就往下滴\n每一口呼吸 闭上眼聆听\n就感觉到你 深深爱着你\nThis is how I feel, the way I feel\nThis is how I feel, the way I feel\nThis is how I feel, the way I feel\nThis is how I feel, the way I feel\n"
