  "lyric_text": "\n\n\nI know what you thinking when you see me like this\nLike a bird in the cage feeling hopeless\nYou can save your mercy on me no one would know\nYou are the blackhole that drugs me into the abyss\nholding on, don't kill this song,\nI know you and I we don't get along but I've been trying hard to prove myself that I won't never let you down but you're so sure I will\nYou are like the mid-night dream\nI'm drowning while I let you in\nWe won't feel a thing\nin this deep dark labyrinth\nForsake the daylight\nlack of sunshine\nI'm lost inside\nthe ice wall to catch fire\nWant my way back\nbut too late for that\nI lost my mind\nbut I know what I desire\nPour the water\ntalking ****\nI need more sugar\nwhen we kiss\nhigh on your lips\nI've been additiced to this\nbring it on your glory drum\nsmash my skin to hear the sound\nof my soul how it breaks down\nshould be a joyful sound\nI'm accusing you\nfor saying what you say\nturning me on in a bad way\nbut you're the best thing in the worst case\nyour presence is my sin right in the first place\nI shouldn't do what I wanna do cause that would be a crime if I fall for you\nnail me on the wooden cross and burn it all\nall my crazy thoughts\nI know I couldn't ask for more\nWe are far from shore\nit's a sea no one ever cross\nForsake the daylight\nlack of sunshine\nI'm lost inside\nthe ice wall to catch fire\nWant my way back\nbut too late for that\nI lost my mind\nbut I know what I desire\n"
