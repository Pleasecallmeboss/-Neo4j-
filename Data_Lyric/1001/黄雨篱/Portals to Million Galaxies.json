  "lyric_text": "\n\n\n\nCold as winter freeze\nDeep as bottomless sea\nBeyond the mortal’s reach\nTo salvage a crystal tear\n\nThis may not be the place I’m supposed to be\nBut the echo woven in my mind is tempting me\nTo dive into abyss\nTo dive into\n\nYour eyes are portals to a million galaxies\nShow me the way to the stars I’d rather be\nA new reality, a new philosophy of\nLove\nI do believe, I always believe\n\nThe shadow rise from deep\nAs we heading to the steep\nThe clock is winding down\nBefore the dark takes over me\n\nI must chase up a ghost from past that’s hunting me\nTame the turbulence and find my missing piece\nThat was buried underneath\nBuried underneath\n\nYour eyes are portals to a million galaxies\nShow me the way to the stars I’d rather be\nA new reality, a new philosophy of\nLove\nI do believe, I always believe\n\nIt ain’t going no where you know\nIt’s always right there you know\nNo matter how long the desolated road is, Or till our separated soul meet\nNo matter how far we go\nNow we calling it hope to go to great beyond\nThe painful miserableness\nThe gateway is open and we should do this\nWe should do this together\n\nYour eyes are portals to a million galaxies\nShow me the way to the stars I’d rather be\nA new reality, a new philosophy of\nLove\nI do believe, I always believe\n\n\n\n"
