  "lyric_text": "\n\nLately I’ve been brought down to my knees\nIt never happened before that frightens me\nYou see baby I wasn’t prepared for all of this\nYou see baby I foresaw everything but this\nI don’t wanna get out, cause that would be like a renegade\nI don’t wanna get in too deep I can’t break free\nYou see baby I wasn’t meant to be like this\nYou see baby I could’ve been much less than this\nI just wanna love so baby I just wanna lie\nShed a light shed a light till it’s burning\nForget about the codes and just stick onto this vibe\nI won’t be diplomatic for the first time\nOh~ You know you don’t have to fight this baby\nWe could let it be so maybe we should let it drive\nKeep talking baby keep keep talking till I sleep\nYour lips would be the very sedate that I need\nI couldn’t help it that I starts to say something inappropriate\nIf you could forgive my manner you would be much appreciated\nI was ghoul in the darkest nights on bed\nPraying on my sanity, anger, and regret\nIt’s like a garden tomb, tomb that I dig\nBurying my sound sleep burying all my dreams\nBut then it starts to bloom with bones and oozes and everything that\nI thought was doomed\nIn my lifeless tomb but then I somehow realize it was you\nWho transfuse, your blood, my juice\nAnd you just keep on pumping\nI just wanna love so baby I just wanna lie\nShed a light shed a light till it’s burning\nForget about the codes and just stick onto this vibe\nI won’t be diplomatic for the first time\nOh~ You know you don’t have to fight this baby\nWe could let it be so maybe we should let it drive\nI just wanna love so baby I just wanna lie\nCut it off cut it off cut off all the ties\nWe should lose all the reasons and never ask why\nIt’s happen, happen, happening up up up high\nOh~ You know you don’t have to fight this baby\nYou might just be mine so baby you might just be fine\n"
