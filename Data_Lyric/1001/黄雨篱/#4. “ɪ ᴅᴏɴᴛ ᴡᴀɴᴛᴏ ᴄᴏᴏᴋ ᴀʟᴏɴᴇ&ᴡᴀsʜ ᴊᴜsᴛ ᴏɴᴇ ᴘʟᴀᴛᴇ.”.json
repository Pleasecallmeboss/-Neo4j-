  "lyric_text": "\n\n\n\n\nEver cry for girl at night\nEver buy it even you know it’s lie\nEver hurt when you’re not the guy\nEver wonder why she said goodbye\nEver realize the true demise\nEver take for granted for your pride\nEver sleep with the guilt inside\nEver dare questioning that life\nI still live part of my life as a meme of your vibe\nIt’s been everywhere I go\nFor that I pay respect\nOh, the long-time dedication and my childish expectation\nHas been overdue, oh wrongfully used\nJust one serving, that is just what I deserve\nNo more debating about who’s turn to make dinner\nI got all the herbs you need pretending you still here\nThey shall soon wither, they shall all wither\nBasil was my favorite; I love you get them in the plates\nI never forget that taste, secret ingredients called heartbreak\nThe life is withering away, but I ain’t planning to replace\nEverything is so vague, I can only see my own fate\nI know it’s not fair\nYou don’t have to act like you care\nOh dear, I’ve been acting like a jerk all these years,\nI thought you’d never go\nMy mind was too slow to even thought about this blow\nSo low, I never been this low\nI’m in the summer but I still feel this chill\nThere’s a hole, and I’m gonna fall for it\nWithout you, gravity’s the last thing I need\nEver cry for girl at night\nEver buy it even you know it’s lie\nEver hurt when you’re not the guy\nEver wonder why she said goodbye\nEver realize the true demise\nEver take for granted for your pride\nEver sleep with the guilt inside\nEver dare questioning that life\n"
