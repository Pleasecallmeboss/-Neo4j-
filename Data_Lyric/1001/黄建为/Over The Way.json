  "lyric_text": "\n\nThe sunshine’s come,\nthe flowers dance along the river,\nthe mountain.\nIt’s cold in the stream,\nI jump in and swim,\nbeing a dreamer,\nsaying nothing in words.\nApproaching to a child,\nignoring the crowd.\nI hear my heart beats,\nit’s so real.\nNameless song,\nI’ve sung it over the way.\nAnd maybe I’ll be alone\nto be on the tramp with the moon.\nSo you empty the roads\nleading the craft for truth.\nCause I don’t have wings to fly\nso freely like birds in the sky.\nI’ll have to let go of mind\nto soar in the wind and smile.\nApproaching to a child,\nignoring the crowd.\nI hear my heart beats,\nit’s so real.\nNameless song,\nI’ve sung it over the way.\n"
